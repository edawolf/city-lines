# Development Workflow

## Build System
- Primary command: `bun run dev` for development
- Build: `bun run build` (includes linting and TypeScript compilation)
- Linting: `bun run lint` using ESLint with Prettier

## Asset Processing
Assets are automatically processed by AssetPack during build:
- Source files in `raw-assets/` are processed to `public/assets/`
- Supports texture packing, format conversion, and optimization
- Use development server for hot-reloading asset changes

## Testing Approach
User prefers providing test results manually rather than opening multiple terminal windows. When testing:
- Focus on visual/functional testing
- Use debug graphics for layout verification
- Test on multiple screen sizes and orientations

## Deployment
- Project deploys to Vercel
- Uses 'gcloud deploy' for simplified deployment when applicable
- Cloud Build handles build and deploy steps automatically

## Documentation
Reference guides in `LUDEMIC_CONTEXT/`:
- [PIXI_JS_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.MD](mdc:LUDEMIC_CONTEXT/PIXI_JS_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.MD) for comprehensive PixiJS patterns
- [DEBUG_GRAPHICS.MD](mdc:LUDEMIC_CONTEXT/DEBUG_GRAPHICS.MD) for layout testing

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules with Prettier formatting
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Comment complex game logic and algorithms
