# PixiJS Game Project Structure

This project uses a custom game engine built on PixiJS v8+ with the following structure:

## Core Files
- [main.ts](mdc:src/main.ts) - Entry point that initializes the CreationEngine
- [engine.ts](mdc:src/engine/engine.ts) - Core game engine implementation
- [vite.config.ts](mdc:vite.config.ts) - Build configuration with asset processing

## Directory Structure
- `src/app/` - Application-specific code (screens, UI components, utils)
- `src/engine/` - Reusable game engine systems (audio, navigation, resize)
- `src/app/screens/` - Game screens (LoadScreen, MainScreen)
- `src/app/ui/` - Reusable UI components (Button, Label, etc.)
- `public/assets/` - Processed game assets (images, sounds, atlases)
- `raw-assets/` - Source assets before processing
- `LUDEMIC_CONTEXT/` - Documentation and development guides

## Package Management
- Uses bun as package manager (prefer bun over npm)
- Uses Vite for development and hot reloading
- Deploys to Vercel with Tailwind CSS v3 support

## Asset Pipeline
Assets are processed by AssetPack and organized into bundles for optimal loading.
